# Archive

Completed implementation documents and historical documentation.

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation that was created during implementation phases but is no longer actively maintained or relevant to current operations:

- **Implementation summaries** - Post-implementation reports for specific features
- **Migration guides** - Completed migration documentation
- **Deprecated specifications** - Superseded design documents
- **Historical records** - Legacy documentation for reference

## Current Contents

### [TC-FrontendApplication.md](TC-FrontendApplication.md)

Historical frontend E2E test specification (32 test cases). Superseded by the Playwright test specs in `frontend/test-specs/`.

## Archive Policy

Documents are moved to the archive when:

1. **Implementation Complete** - Feature is implemented and tested
2. **Documentation Updated** - Information incorporated into main docs
3. **Historical Value Only** - Useful for reference but not for active development
4. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer documentation

## Accessing Archive Documents

Archive documents are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding past decisions
- Compliance and audit purposes
- Learning from completed implementations
